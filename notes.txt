Random notes on golfscript.rb

* When converting [int] to str, each int gets truncated to a byte.
  For example, "[260]''+" == "[4]''+".

* Sorting a list with more than one type crashes. Haskell simply uses the
  derived Ord instance (where Int < Arr < Str < Blk).

* For many operations, Blk behaves exactly like a Str, for example sorting.

* For "order" operators like */%, "str arr op" gets reordered to "arr str op",
  which could be surprising.
